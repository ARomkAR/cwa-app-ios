	/// - We store the public key of our server (depends on landscape, we have two public keys right now)
	/// - Neither the .bin or .sig data is encrypted (besides in transit), but the .sig file stores an encrypted SHA256 hash of the .bin file
	/// - The server has signed this hash with their private key.
	///
	/// The actual checking is performed as follows:
	/// 1. Deserialze the `signature` `Data` into the corresponding model `SAP_TEKSignature`
	/// 2. Decrypt the therein contained signature with out public key
	/// 3. We now have the SHA256 hash of the .bin file
	/// 4. Hash the .bin file, and compare the two.
	/// 5. If they match, we can be sure that they have not been tampered with and originated from our server.
